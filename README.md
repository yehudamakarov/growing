## Description

If you do something one day that you know is good for you, start doing it once a week. Maybe start doing it twice a week. Don't bug yourself out about getting it done. Let the good habit unfold without the stress of building it.

Write down why you would want to do it again, so next time, in case you don't feel it, you'll still jump in. Get that habit built.

## Install Instructions

For now, clone the repository, (download the folder containing all the code to you machine,) `cd` to the directory, (open a command prompt window and make sure you navigate to the folder holding all the code,) and run the shotgun gem!

This will launch a server on your machine, go there, and signup. Then you can see your homepage which is a week view of tasks that you can add. The sidebar has relevant links depending on where in the app you find yourself.
